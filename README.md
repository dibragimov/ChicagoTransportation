# TDI Capstone project idea

This will be the project to improve the public transportation system of Chicago. The data from Chicago taxi trips and Divvy bike sharing system trips will be analysed to discover trends, similar patterns and preferences of the travellers. 
Then, based on the discoveries, some suggestions will be made to improve the public transportation system. The weather information is also proposed to be taken into consideration.
Also, as a part of the project, the app which will offer possible options together with time estimates will be developed.
